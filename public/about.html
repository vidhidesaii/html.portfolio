<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there!<br>
   I am Vidhi Desai ,I am 18 , from India and an aspiring Web Developer <br>
   When I was in 10th standard I had a subject called computer applications in which we got to study different languages , learn about the internet, netwroking systems, etc.etc.<br>
   While learning HTML, it got me interested into trying to create more and more non-active websites and got creative day by day after practicing.
   <br>Then came the time of learning python and after learning that I got more interested and excited to learn new attributes and new tags in the language.
   There were times when i used to get bored while i got stuck during the process of coding and later when I used to find out the mistake which was as silly as a comma made me giggle and 
   gave a feeling of achivement and now I thrive for that feeling.
</p>

<p>Coding for me is like when there is some tension in my life like a fight with a friend,stress of college,assignments lined up etc.etc.
  I start coding a website or a webpage. It makes me relaxed and focused at the same time!
  Coding teaches you to overcome difficulties be it finding that missing comma or a spelling error or be it coding a complicated program.
  During the process of coding a piece of webpage/website you come to know the real ability of your mind to think critically and once you have completed building a website or completed 
  a complex program, you feel happy and satisfied!

</p>

<p>So here on this website I am gonna show off my work that I have done in a long course of time!
  <br>So here is hoping you get insipired a little and start to code because that's what the fututre holds!
  
</p>
<p>
  HAPPY CODING !!
